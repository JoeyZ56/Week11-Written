    <li>1. What is Express in Node.js and why is it used?</li>

    <ol>express is a framework used in node to build web applications</ol>

    <li>2. How does Mongoose help in using MongoDB with Node.js?</li>

    <ol>its an interface tool for js shell to link mongodb to your code</ol>

    <li>3. Can you explain the role of Mongoose in managing relationships between data?</li>

    <ol>mongoose links your code to the mongodb data base your code can live online</ol>

    <li>4. What is a software design pattern? Give an example.</li>

    <ol>a reusable solution to commonly occuring problems in tour code</ol>

    <li>5. Can you explain the MVC architecture in detail?</li>

    <ol>is a pattern in software to design user interface, data, and controlling logs</ol>

    <li>6. What roles do Model, View, and Controller play in the MVC architecture?</li>

    <ol>they are folders in your code that hold data for the user interface or connecting programs to the server</ol>

    <li>7. Define Latency and Throughput in the context of APIs.</li>

    <ol>latency is how fast a data loads, and through put is how muhc data can be successfully moved from one server to another</ol>

    <li>8. Why is it important to minimize latency and maximize throughput in APIs?</li>

    <ol>higher latency is will increase the amount of time packets are transfered and a lower throughput will effect the amount of packets being processed at one time</ol>

    <li>9. What is Authentication in terms of web development?</li>

    <ol>Website authentication is the security process that allows users to verify their identities to gain access to their personal accounts</ol>

    <li>10. How does the authorization process start?</li>

    <ol>its starts by asking for the private information the user as inputed</ol>

    <li>11. What is express.staticused for in Express?</li>

    <ol>exposes a directory or a file to a particular URL so it's contents can be publicly accessed.</ol>

    <li>12. Can you give an example of serving static files using express.static?</li>

    <ol>images or CSS are example of static files</ol>

    <li>13. What is Jest and why is it used?</li>

    <ol>Jest is a JavaScript testing framework it is used to test your code before depoying to the internet</ol>

    <li>14. How can Supertest be helpful when working with Jest?</li>

    <ol>It give the ability to do long term tests to make sure that the web application doesnt crash after extended periods of time</ol>

    <li>15. Can you describe how manual and automated tests are executed?</li>

    <ol>manual test you create the user informationt to be tested to make sure that all the information is being regesterd in teh server. automated tests run it for you</ol>

    <li>16. What is the difference between unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing?</li>

    <ol>1. Testing: a manual form of testing user experience where you apply the information by hand to be tested <br/>
        2. Integration tests ensure synchronization between modules when they work together to accomplish a specific task <br/>
        3. End-to-end: to test the product the same way a real user experiences it, but done automaticlly<br/></ol>

    <li>17. Can you provide examples of functional, regression, smoke, and performance tests?</li>

    <ol>Functional: the system is tested to validate all the components work perfectly in combination or not<br/>
        Regression: test that was developed at the initial launch of a certain feature <br/>
        Smoke: determine whether the most crucial functions of the software are working as intended or not<br/>
        Performance: is a programming code specific to performance testing to automate the real-world user behaviour<br/>
    </ol>

    <li>18. What is meant by positive testing and negative testing in a functional testing context?</li>

    <ol>positive: a software testing technique which divides the input data into many partitions<br/>
        negative: a technique used to introduce errors or faults into a system to test how it responds<br/>
    </ol>

    <li>19. How does load testing assess the behavior of software?</li>

    <ol>examines how the system behaves during normal and high loads</ol>

    <li>20. What aspects does usability testing assess in a software application?</li>

    <ol>a testing technique used to evaluate how easily the user can use the software</ol>

    <li>21. Why is security testing crucial in a software development life cycle?</li>

    <ol>to ensure the software is free of any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses</ol>

    <li>22. Can you explain what compatibility testing is?</li>

    <ol>to ensure the applications compatibility with different computing environments</ol>

    <li>23. What is the aim of recovery testing and why is it important?</li>

    <ol>is the activity of testing how well an application is able to recover from crashes. It is important so the company doesnt lose a lot of money from the systems being down</ol>

    <li>24. What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and who typically performs it?</li>

    <ol>also known as beta testing, application testing or end-user testing, and its the final testing performed after the functional, system, and regression testing stages are over</ol>

    <li>25. Can you describe a scenario in which you would use each of the different testing types mentioned in the
        notes?</li>

    <ol>When making an MMO RPG that requires a live server, account, payment system that all need to be protected and running conistantly</ol>
